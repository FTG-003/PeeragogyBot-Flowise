## `README.md` ‚Äî PeeragogyBot: An AI-Powered Peer Learning Companion

### 1. Introduction
**PeeragogyBot** is an open-source conversational assistant designed to enhance collaborative learning through AI. Inspired by the principles of *Pyragogy* ‚Äî a fusion of Peeragogy and artificial intelligence ‚Äî it serves as a co-learner, guide, and reflective partner in human-AI knowledge co-creation.

### 2. Philosophy & Manifesto
This project is grounded in the [Pyragogy Manifesto](https://github.com/FTG-003/Pyragogy-Hub), a set of 10 core principles that define ethical, transparent, and joyful collaboration between humans and AI. PeeragogyBot embodies these values through adaptive scaffolding, radical openness, and cognitive co-evolution.
